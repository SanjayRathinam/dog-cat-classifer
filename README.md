# Dog vs Cat Image Classification using CNN

This project uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) built with TensorFlow
to classify images as Dog or Cat.

## Features
- Binary image classification
- CNN with Conv2D and MaxPooling layers
- Image preprocessing and normalization
- Single image prediction support

## Dataset
Dog and Cat images stored in separate folders.
(Dataset not uploaded due to size limits)

## Technologies Used
- Python
- TensorFlow / Keras
- Google Colab

## How to Run
1. Upload dataset.zip in Google Colab
2. Run the notebook step by step
3. Upload a test image to get prediction

## Output
Predicts whether the input image is a Dog 🐶 or Cat 🐱
